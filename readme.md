we usesed the Google Calendar API to create a new event in a user's Google calendar, by importing the necessary classes from the Google Calendar API, including classes for creating a calendar service instance and working with events. It also imports a class from another source file called `quickstart`, which may indicate that the code is excerpted from a larger project. 
Overall, the program is a simple example of how to use the Google Calendar API to interact with a user's calendar and add new events.
"Everything was developed by SADKI Mohammed and JOVIEN Sylvain through pair programming, as we had some difficulties during the development process."
